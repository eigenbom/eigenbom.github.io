    (TODO: Explanation)
    
    My core proficiencies are C++ and games development. I’m also very familiar with Python and have had experience with most other languages, including Java, Typescript, C#, Haskell, Lua, and Lisp. I’ve had experience with developing game engines and using existing engines like Unity and Unreal.
    
    From my experience running a games studio I'd developed a solid understanding of software engineering, including the architecture of game engines, object-oriented principles, entity-component systems, and event-driven programming. I’ve had experience with a broad range of development tools across the major operating systems, including compilers, debugging tools, build systems, graphics debuggers, profiling tools, and static analysers. I’ve had extensive experience with prototyping, developing, testing and shipping software.

    I received a games production grant from Film Victoria. The grant was used to employ contractors, including a concept artist, pixel artist, musician and programmer. I was required to regularly submit budget and progress reports.
